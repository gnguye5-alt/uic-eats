## Modifications made from original prototype
Checkout Page:
- We ultimately decided against creating an "offers section" to apply promotions along with removing the seperate page for the 
promotions as we felt there was a way to simplify it and reduce clutter off the screen. We opted for having a popup displaying the
available promotins and a section for manual entry of promo codes. This simplified our checkout page quite a bit.
We also added the automatic calculation for fees and any added promotions in the same price breakdwon box.The delivery address also has a strict format for the map to properly work in the tracking page. EX: 1234 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607.

Reviews Pages
- The reviews page was modified when displaying all reviews for a particular restaraunt. The filter displays based on quantity of stars and not based on specifc food items as we have added a review section for each item individually. 

## How to run
-npm start on computer
-using mobile device on local network : type in link displayed in terminal

AI usage:
We used AI for debugging purposes when we reached serious issues as we all had limited experince and knowledge with React. We used Claude as a resource to help guide us through the development process when debugging became an issue.
