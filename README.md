## Modifications made from original prototype
Checkout Page:
- We ultimately decided against creating an "offers section" to apply promotions along with removing the seperate page for the 
promotions as we felt there was a way to simplify it and reduce clutter off the screen. We opted for having a popup displaying the
available promotins and a section for manual entry of promo codes. This simplified our checkout page quite a bit.
We also added the automatic calculation for fees and any added promotions in the same price breakdwon box.The delivery address also has a strict format for the map to properly work in the tracking page. EX: 1234 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607.

Reviews Pages:
- The reviews page was modified when displaying all reviews for a particular restaraunt. The filter displays based on quantity of stars and not based on specifc food items as we have added a review section for each item individually. 

Landing Page:
- The active group orders have been removed from the original landing page. When users want to place a group order they will simply click on the group order button on the top right corner of the landing page.

## How to run
In the project directory, you can run:
npm start, it will run the app in the development mode.
If you're testing on your phone, copy the local server URL (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:3000) and open it in your phoneâ€™s browser. Make sure your phone and laptop are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

-Bootcamps and in class notes/assignments were incredibly helpful

AI usage:
We used AI for debugging purposes when we reached serious issues as we all had limited experince and knowledge with React. We used Claude as a resource to help guide us through the development process when debugging became an issue.
